## Quick Start ðŸš€


1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-blog/
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/about.md`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

    Edit `gatsby.config.js` to update site metadata.

    Add blog posts in markdown in `src/pages/blog/`. Each blog should have a `title` and `date` frontmatter. Example blog posts have been provided.
